# Base view <a name="base-view"></a>

This is the base view for all Ribcage views. Every new Ribcage view should
extend this view, and any API that is common to all views should be implemented
by this view.

Currently this view offers no special API. It merely serves as a placeholder.

This module is in UMD format and will create `ribcage.views.BaseView`,
`ribcage.viewMixins.BaseView`, and `ribcage.views.baseView` globals if not used
with an AMD loader such as RequireJS.

This module depends on Backbone.

## `baseViewMixin` <a name="baseviewmixin"></a>

The base view mixin. This mixin contains all the APIs that will be mixed into
all Ribcage views.

It is currently a stub, but you should generally extend `BaseView` constructor
to build all Ribcage views.

Please see the documentation on [`baseViewMixin`](#baseviewmixin) for more
information about this view.
